[color=blue][b][size=12pt][u]Introduction[/u][/size][/b][/color]
This modification adds the phpBB-style font size BBcode to the forum, where the parameter in the size bbcode is a percentage from 10% to 999% (without the percentage sign).

This code allows users to use size syntax like this:
[code][size=150][/size]
[size=150%][/size][/code]
