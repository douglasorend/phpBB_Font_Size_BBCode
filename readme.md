## Introduction
This modification adds the phpBB-style font size BBcode to the forum, where the parameter in the size bbcode is a percentage from 10% to 999% (without the percentage sign).

This code allows users to use size syntax like this:
    ## [/size]
    [size=150%]

## Admin Settings
There are no admin settings to this mod.  To disable, you must uninstall this mod.

## Compatibility Notes
This mod was tested on SMF 2.0.9, but should work on SMF 2.1 Beta 1, as well as SMF 2.0 and up.  SMF 1.x is not and will not be supported.
